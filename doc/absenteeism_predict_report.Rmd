# Summary

> In this project, we are trying to address the following **predictive question**: 

> Based on some given information of an employee, regarding personal, working and health ambits, how many hours of absence would be expected from that employee in a given month?

In this project we built three machine learning models, which are random forest regressor, support vector machine regressor with linear kernel and ridge regressor, to make predictions on absenteeism time in hours from "Absenteeism at work" dataset. Our machine learning models did not perform a very good job even after we applied recursive feature elimination. From feature selection, we found that the most impactful feature is "Reason for absence". The best mean cross-validation $R^2$ score we got is 0.09 from `ridge regressor`, and the other 2 validation scores are 0.05 from `support vector machine regressor with linear kernel` and -0.15 from `random forest regressor`. Thus, we used `ridge regression` model on the test data and our test score is 0.085. Our unsatisfied prediction results may affect the decision and judgement that an employer make while dealing with absenteeism among employees. Thus, We suggest that more sophisticated approaches on feature selection and machine learning models should be applied on this data to improve the prediction results; alternatively, a more representative and independent dataset is needed to perform the prediction upon, in order to gain the correct direction on absenteeism issues.

# Introduction

Absenteeism in the workplace is the habitual absence behavior from work without a valid reason[@CIPD]. It is a very common case experienced by employers and it has become a serious problem that employers always want to deal with. The UK Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development(also known as CIPD) estimated that employers had to pay Â£595 on each employee per year and which is caused by 7.6 absent days from each worker on average in 2013[@book2]. In addition to higher financial costs, absenteeism might lead to reduced productivity levels and low morale in workplaces, which affects the overall operation of an organization.

Here we would like to experiment if we could use a machine learning model to make predictions and find the most influential features on absenteeism. If employers can use the results to predict absenteeism among employees, they can make effective plans in advance to deal with the upcoming problems and reduce extra costs caused by absenteeism.

# Data

We chose a data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository called "Absenteeism at work Data Set". The data set can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work#) and it is created by Andrea Martiniano, Ricardo Pinto Ferreira, and Renato Jose Sassi from Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management at Nove de Julho University, Rua Vergueiro[@data]. The data was collected at a courier company in Brazil and the database includes the monthly records of absenteeism of 36 different workers over three years, starting from July 2007, and how their changes affect their absence rate over time. This data set contains 740 instances with 21 attributes, including 8 categorical and 11 numerical features (excluding the target `Absenteeism time in hours` and the drop feature `ID`). Each row represents information about an employee's situations of absence, family, workload, and other factors that might be related to absence at work. Out of the considered attributes, the absenteeism in hours is our prediction target.

# Methods

### Analysis tools

We used both R[@R] and Python[@Python] programming languages to perform this prediction task. The following R and Python packages were used: tidyverse[@tidyverse], dplyr[@dplyr], knitr[@knitr], ggcorrplot[@ggcorrplot], docopt R[@docopt], docopt Python[@docoptpython], feather Python[@featherpy], os[@Python], Pandas[@mckinney-proc-scipy-2010], and scikit-learn[@sklearn_api]. The code used to perform the analysis and create this report can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-522_group-21). 

### Data preprocessing

Prior to preliminary data analysis and building the model, we splitted the data into a training and a test set (70% : 30% split). We assume that the test data set is representative of the deployment data that the model is going to face in the future. There the test data set will be saved and only be used to predict and score the trained model. In addition, we built a preprocessing pipeline for all features: simple scaler for numeric features, one hot encoding for both categorical and binary features, ordinal encoding for ordinal features, and drop step for `ID`.

### Preliminary data Analysis

We performed some exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the training data only: 

From figure 1, We observed that there are some considerable correlations between features, as well as there is bare correlations between the target and respective features. For example, `Disciplinary failure` and `Reason for absence`; `Hit target` and `Month of absence`; `body mass index`/`weight` and `service time` seem to be highly correlated features. 

```{r correlation matrix, fig.cap="Figure 1. Correlation matrix between all features and the target", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/correlation_matrix.png")
```

We also looked into the distributions (figure 2) of each feature and the target and we detect many outliers in the target. 

```{r frequency distributions, fig.cap="Figure 2. Frequency distributions for all features and the target", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/distribution_plot.png")
```

We also examined the distribution for the particular feature `Reason of Absence` (figure 3.), which has one of the relatively highest correlation with the target, and observe that justifications 22 (medical consultation) and 27 (Dental Consultation) are the most common, causing the reasons for absence in 191 out of the 508 observations taken.

```{r reasons of Absence distribution, fig.cap="Figure 3. Reasons of Absence feature distribution", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/frequency_plot.png")
```

### Prediction models & evaluation metric

Post EDA, we are ready to use supervised machine learning models to perform prediction and to obtain the most suitable algorithm for our Abseentism prediction task. The models we chose are: 

* `support vector machine with linear kernel` - we chose this model for its accuracy when a considerable amount of features are utilized. 

* `ridge regressor` - we selected this model to better deal with multicollinearity between the features.

* `random forest regressor` - we chose this model for its efficiency and easiness to view relative feature importance.

For evaluation metric, $R^2$ score is used to assess how these models perform, as it measures how well the models adapt and represent the data, with 1 being making a perfect prediction and 0 being not having any predicting power.

# Prediction results

### Cross validation

First, We performed cross validation on the train data set with 5 cross-validation folds using all 3 machine learning models. Table 1 shows the original mean cross-validation $R^2$ scores for each prediction model. The $R^2$ score for `support vector machine with linear kernel` is 0.06 and for `ridge regressor` is 0.07, while `random forest regressor` has a score of -0.16 which was very bad. It is noteworthy that there is no obvious overfitting problem with `support vector machine with linear kernel` or `ridge regressor` models; however `random forest regressor` seems to suffer from severe overfitting as its training score is 0.84 which is drastically higher than its negative cross-validation score. Given these poorly performing cross-validation scores, we proceed with feature selection to try to filter down to the most important features and train our models accordingly again. 

```{r non REF cv results}
non_RFE_CV_results <- read_feather("../results/non_RFE_CV_results.feather")
knitr::kable(non_RFE_CV_results, caption = "Table 1. Non feature selection mean cross validation R-square scores of all three machine learning models")
```


### Feature selection & hyperparameter tuning

We used recursive feature elimination and cross-validated selection (`RFECV`) along with the 3 machine learning models to cross validation again and obtain the mean cross-validation $R^2$ scores based on the most important features selected. Table 2 shows that during `RFECV` feature selection, `ridge regressor` performed the best and obtained a higher than before $R^2$ score of 0.097 compared to `support vector machine with linear kernel` which produced a similar $R^2$ score of 0.06 and `random forest regressor` which again yielded a negative $R^2$ score.

```{r REF cv results}
RFE_CV_results <- read_feather("../results/RFE_CV_results.feather")
knitr::kable(RFE_CV_results, caption = "Table 2. Feature selection mean cross validation R-square scores of all three machine learning models")
```

As a result, we picked `ridge regressor` as our prediction model, specifically, we used `ridge regression with built-in cross-validation` which contains an in-built hyperparameter tuning mechanism. The most optimal hyperparameter alpha given by the model is 10, and the 13 most important features selected by REFCV are listed in descending order shown in table 3. With the top 11 most important features all coming from `Reason for absence`, plus the `month July` and whether or not an employee has `disciplinary failure` being the last 2 most important features out of the 13.

```{r best coefficients}
best_coefficients <- read_feather("../results/best_coefficients.feather")
knitr::kable(best_coefficients, caption = "Table 3. Most important Features selected with associated coefficients under ridge regressor prediction model")
```

### Test result

Now we are ready to use `ridge regressor` as the best prediction model on our test data set. The final test $R^2$ score we got is 0.085. Similar to the cross validation scores we got, again this is a very low $R^2$ closer to 0, which is essentially implying the best prediction model we selected does not have much predicting power, and the 13 most important features selected do not influence the target that much. As a result, it is insufficient to use our machine learning model to predict how many hours of absence from a worker in a given month.   

# Discussions

### Critique

There are limitations and assumptions associated with our prediction task:

* The dataset is collected from one single courier company in Brazil, which means that the data might not be independent and representative of the population that we are interested in predicting.

* From the preliminary data analysis, we see that there is no strong correlation between each single feature and the target, which is a signal that there might not be a great representation of target from the given features. There are obvious multicollinearity in between features which could have affected our prediction model performance.

* In addition, from the frequency distributions, there are many outliers in our target which potentially also make our model prediction power very low, as our model was trained towards fitting the outliers.

### Future directions

Given the current Machine Learning tools we have learned so far, unfortunately, we were unable to fully answer the predictive question that we are interested in answering. However, we did obtain a better understanding of the Absenteeism at Work data, and its respective features. If we were to have more time to explore deeper, we would 1. research into more advanced machine learning models that particularly deal with multicollinear data and outlier data; 2. find and use a more representative and independent dataset that could better represent the population.
