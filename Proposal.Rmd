# 1. Introduction

In this project, we are trying to address the following question: based on some given information of an employee, how many hours of absence would be expected from the employee?

### 1.1 Problem Description
Absenteeism in workplace is the habitual absence behaviour from work without a valid reason[@CIPD]. It is a very common case experienced by employers and it has become a serious problem that employers always want to deal with. The UK Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development(also known as CIPD) estimated that employers had to pay Â£595 on each employee per year and which is cost by 7.6 absent days from each worker on average in 2013[@book2]. In addition to higher financial costs, absenteeism might lead to reduced productivity levels and low morale in workplaces, which affects the overall operation of an organization. A statistical way to deal with this problem is that we can figure out the most impactful factors that can cause absenteeism and make predictions according to characteristics of different individuals. If employers can use the results to predict the absenteeism among employees, they can make effective plans in advance to deal with the upcoming problems and reduce extra costs caused by absenteeism. 

To help employers deal with absenteeism related issues, we would like to use statistical way to make predictions and find impactive factors on absenteeism. Our project focuses on using machine learning methods to learn from absenteeism at work data set and make predictions on different individuals after finding out the main factors that would lead to absent from work.

### 1.2 Data Set 
We chose a data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository called "Absenteeism at work Data Set". The data set can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work) and it is created by Andrea Martiniano, Ricardo Pinto Ferreira, and Renato Jose Sassi from Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management at Nove de Julho University, Rua Vergueiro[@data]. The data was collected at a courier company in Brazil and the database includes records of absenteeism at work in three years starting from July 2007. This data set contains 740 instances with 21 attributes including categorical and numerical ones. Each row represents statistics from a different employee with his/her situations of absence, family, work load and other factors that might be related to his/her absence at work. One of the attributes being absenteeism in hours is our target and our features are: Individual Identification (ID), Reason for absence, Month of absence, Day of the week, Seasons, Transportation Expense, Distance from residence to work, Service Time, Age, Work load Average/day, Hit target (achievement of periodic goals in percentage), Disciplinary failure, Education, Son, Social Drinker, Social smoker, Pet, Weight, Height and Body Mass Index. 

# 2. Potential Approaches

In general, we will divide our project into three phases. Before building the model, we will split the data into a training data set and a test data set (70% : 30% split). We will perform exploratory data analysis in the training data set only and will test the performance of our model on the test data set. Exploratory data analysis will be carried out to assess whether there are correlations between features that we would need to consider when choosing a model and whether there is a reason that has an extremely high amount of absence that we should assign more weight to it when building the model. We are also interested in seeing the distribution of each features and the target to detect any outliers. Therefore, we will generate a correlation plot and some distribution plots for each features. In particular, we will also generate a frequency table and a histogram for the Reason of Absence feature to understand what reason is more prevalent than others.

After finishing the explanatory analysis, we will chose supervised machine learning methods as our baseline models and then implement those algorithms. The models we have chosen including dummy regressor, ridge regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression and support vector machine with RBF kernel. For each model we pick up the best hyperparameters after implying cross validation with those algorithms. Finally, we will predict on absenteeism time in hours of each individuals in test set with those estimators. For evaluation metrics, we are going to use mean squared error and R square because we would like to take a wider approach on how the models work. We will evaluate the overall performance for each model with main impactive factors and the results will be included in the final report.
